# configure MFA in IAM
### For free increased security AWS recommends to setup Multi-Factor Authentication
## MFA types
#### Contents
  - passkeys and security keys
  - virtual auth applications
  - harware totp tokens

#### To enable a passkey or security key for your root user (console)
  - Open the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and signin using root creds
  - On the right side of the navigation bar, choose your account name, and then choose **Security credentials**
    
      ![AWS Security Credentials!](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/security-credentials-root.shared.console.png "AWS Security Credentials")

  - On your root user **My security credentials** page, under **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, choose **Assign MFA device**
  - On the **MFA device name** page, enter a **Device name**, choose **Passkey or Security Key**, and then choose **Next**.
  - On **Set up device**, set up your passkey. Create a passkey with biometric data like your face or fingerprint, with a device pin, or by inserting the FIDO security key into your computer's USB port and tapping it.
  - Follow the instructions on your browser to choose a passkey provider or where you want to store your passkey to use across your devices
  - Choose **Continue**

You have now registered your passkey for use with AWS. The next time you use your root user credentials to sign in, you must authenticate with your passkey to complete the sign-in process.

#### To configure and enable a virtual MFA device for use with your root user (console)
  - Open the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and signin using root creds
  - On the right side of the navigation bar, choose your account name, and then choose **Security credentials**
    
      ![AWS Security Credentials!](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/security-credentials-root.shared.console.png "AWS Security Credentials")

  - In the **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** section, choose **Assign MFA** device.
  - In the wizard, type a **Device name**, choose **Authenticator app**, and then choose **Next**.IAM generates and displays configuration     information for the virtual MFA device, including a QR code graphic. The graphic is a representation of the secret configuration key       that is available for manual entry on devices that do not support QR codes.
  - Open the virtual MFA app on the device.
    If the virtual MFA app supports multiple virtual MFA devices or accounts, choose the option to create a new virtual MFA device or          account.
  - The easiest way to configure the app is to use the app to scan the QR code. If you cannot scan the code, you can type the           configuration information manually. The QR code and secret configuration key generated by IAM are tied to your AWS account and cannot be used with a different account. They can, however, be reused to configure a new MFA device for your account in case you lose access to the original MFA device.
      - To use the QR code to configure the virtual MFA device, from the wizard, choose Show QR code. Then follow the app instructions for scanning the code. For example, you might need to choose the camera icon or choose a command like Scan account barcode, and then use the device's camera to scan the QR code.
      - In the Set up device wizard, choose Show secret key, and then type the secret key into your MFA app.The device starts generating six-digit numbers.
      - In the wizard, in the MFA code 1 box, type the one-time password that currently appears in the virtual MFA device. Wait up to 30 seconds for the device to generate a new one-time password. Then type the second one-time password into the MFA code 2 box. Choose Add MFA.
